# Nitrogen-Tank-Fill-Application
This application is used to fill nitrogen tanks with liquid nitrogen

This application was adapted from the previous application written in Visual Basic

For the controller, we are using a PCI buss which is what all of the bytes are being written to in the program
The main program consists of two seperate programs that control both of the liquid nitrogen fill systems. One with a scale that reads the weight very accurately and on that uses just time to fill

My final goal for this project is to be able to take data from the Scale program (ChemBuildingProgram) and make a very acurate linear model of time vs fill ammount so that the other program (ReedMcDonald) can perform better
I have yet to recieve approval to do so yet, I will update the program if that get implemented
